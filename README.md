# Equiv

It finds equivalents of the things.

The programming world grows so fast. **Loads of packages are being created** day by
day. And there are **so many programming laguages** around. When the developers try
new languages, **they need to reuse their experience**.

`equiv` allows you to use your experience in all programming languages. And **it
makes you adopt a new language faster**.

Let's say you are a **Rubyist** who wants to develop **a web application with Python**.
Since you are a Ruby user, you already know *Sinatra*, but don't know the Python world.
Just use `equiv` and it will find you the **Python equivalent of Sinatra**.
```
equiv sinatra of python
```

It finds the equivalent:
```
ruby/sinatra is a micro web framework
equivalent in python is are:
- flask
  > pip install flask
```

And also you can just use the concepts like `micro_web_framework`
```
equiv micro_web_framework of ruby
```

It finds the best match.
```
equivalent in ruby are:

- sinatra
  > gem install sinatra
```
